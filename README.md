2. Open "application.js" and put in your Parse keys.
3. Run, hack, love, hate, enjoy!

We've put this on Git Hub as much to help others as to solicit help ourseleves. If you see something we could do a better way, please log an issue. We'd like to learn from our mistakes.

**NB:** This project is in no way affiliated with parse-angular-patch or BRANDiD.

Release Notes
==============

- Currently focused on basic CRUD operations.
- Edit functionality still not working right (the Salutation dropdown doesn't retain state).
- No form validation of any kind, yet.
